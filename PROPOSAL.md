### Title: Predicting Forest Cover Types from Cartographic Variables
Natural resource manager have the duty of developing ecosystem management strategies, for this they require basic descriptive information of forested lands to create better strategies. Generally these managers don't have access to data of lands next to their own jurisdiction. One way this could be extracted is through predictive modelling.
In this Project multiple techniques will be used in predicting forest cover type from cartographic variables. The data is from four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado USA.
The cover type for each observation, which is a 30 x 30 meter cell, is from US Forest Service Information System (RIS), Other Independent variables are from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data. The data is in raw format with binary columns of data for qualitative variables for wilderness areas and soil types.


### Goals
The main goal of this project will be to build a predictive model that can classify forest cover type based on all cartographic variables. There are 6 possible forest cover types.
* Correlation between the variables to explore any significant relationships or collinearity
* Analyse Distance variables
* Analyse Soil types
* Analyse Elevation type
* Create a baseline Liner Regression Model
* Feature extractions
* Linear Model with extracted Features
* Build a Naive Bayes Model with extracted feature
* Build a Neural Network with Extracted features
